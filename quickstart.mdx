## Setup your development

Learn how to update your docs locally and deploy them to the public.

### Edit and preview

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone your docs locally">
    During the onboarding process, we created a repository on your Github with
    your docs content. You can find this repository on our
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.speckit.dev). To clone the repository
    locally, follow these steps:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Terminal
      git clone https://github.com/speckit/docs
      cd docs
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview changes">
    Preview changes before pushing to Git. We highly recommend installing the
    Mintlify CLI.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash npm
      npm i -g mintlify
      mintlify dev
      ```

      ```bash yarn
      yarn global add mintlify
      mintlify dev
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
    Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
    don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
    your [dashboard](https://dashboard.speckit.dev). Once the bot has been
    successfully installed, you should see a check mark next to the commit hash of
    the repo.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Terminal
      git add .
      git commit -m "Update docs"
      git push origin main
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
