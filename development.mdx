Step 1. Install Mintlify on your OS:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify

yarn global add mintlify

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Go to the docs are located (where your `mint.json` file is) and run the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

The documentation website is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

Mintlify uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port Mintlify runs on.

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

The documentation website is now available at `http://localhost:3333`.

### Mintlify Versions

Each CLI is linked to a specific version of Mintlify. Please update the CLI if your local website looks different than production.

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add mintlify@latest
```

</CodeGroup>

    lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
    ```

    mintlify dev
    ```
  </Accordion>
