## Welcome to Speckit API

The Speckit API provides programmatic access to all Speckit features. Our REST API is designed to be simple, predictable, and easy to integrate with your applications.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```

```

## Authentication

The Speckit API uses API keys for authentication. Include your API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer your-api-key
```

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys secure and never expose them in client-side code.
</Warning>

## Rate Limits

API requests are rate limited to ensure fair usage:

- **Free tier**: 1,000 requests per hour
