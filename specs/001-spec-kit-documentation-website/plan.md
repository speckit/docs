## Summary
Create a comprehensive documentation website for Spec-Driven Development methodology using Mintlify Cloud platform. The site will provide interactive tutorials, multi-language support (English/Chinese/Japanese), and automated synchronization with the spec-kit submodule to enable teams to adopt SDD practices effectively.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: MDX (Markdown + React), Node.js 18+, TypeScript 5.0+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Mintlify CLI, React 18, Next.js 13+, Tailwind CSS  
**Storage**: Git-based content management, GitHub repository, Mintlify Cloud hosting  
**Testing**: Mintlify dev server, link validation, content accuracy verification  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (modern), mobile-responsive design  
**Project Type**: Documentation website (Mintlify-based static site generation)  
**Performance Goals**: <2s page load, <500ms navigation, 95+ Lighthouse score  
**Constraints**: Mintlify platform limitations, GitHub API rate limits, multi-language content management  
**Scale/Scope**: 32+ documentation pages, 3 languages, automated CI/CD pipeline, GitHub integration

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (documentation website only)
- Using framework directly? ✅ Yes (Mintlify platform, no custom wrappers)
- Single data model? ✅ Yes (MDX content files with frontmatter metadata)
- Avoiding patterns? ✅ Yes (no unnecessary abstractions, direct Mintlify usage)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? ⚠️ ADAPTED: Documentation content as modular MDX files
- Libraries listed: Content modules (methodology, tutorials, examples, reference)
- CLI per library: ✅ Mintlify CLI for development and deployment
- Library docs: ✅ Structured content with clear navigation and cross-references

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? ✅ Content validation → User testing → Refinement
- Git commits show tests before implementation? ✅ Content outlines before full content
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? ✅ Adapted for documentation
- Real dependencies used? ✅ Actual Mintlify platform, real GitHub integration
- Integration tests for: ✅ Content accuracy, navigation flow, submodule sync
- FORBIDDEN: ✅ No content without validation, no broken links or references

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? ✅ Mintlify analytics, GitHub Actions logs
- Frontend logs → backend? ✅ Page analytics → Mintlify dashboard
- Error context sufficient? ✅ Build errors, broken links, sync failures tracked

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? ✅ 1.0.0 (MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD)
- BUILD increments on every change? ✅ Automated via CI/CD pipeline
- Breaking changes handled? ✅ Content migration guides, deprecation notices

**Structure Decision**: Documentation website with modular content organization

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

### Research Tasks Completed:

1. **Mintlify Platform Capabilities**:
   - Decision: Mintlify Cloud with custom domain support
   - Rationale: Existing infrastructure, excellent documentation features, built-in analytics
   - Alternatives considered: GitBook, Docusaurus, custom Next.js site

2. **Multi-language Content Management**:
   - Decision: Mintlify i18n support with structured content organization
   - Rationale: Native platform support, maintainable structure, automated deployment
   - Alternatives considered: External translation services, manual content duplication

3. **Interactive Tutorial Implementation**:
   - Decision: MDX components with embedded code examples and step-by-step guides
   - Rationale: Rich interactivity within Mintlify, maintainable content, good UX
   - Alternatives considered: External tutorial platform, custom React components

4. **CI/CD Pipeline for Submodule Sync**:
   - Decision: GitHub Actions with automated content generation from submodule changes
   - Rationale: Native GitHub integration, reliable automation, version control
   - Alternatives considered: Webhook-based sync, manual update process

**Output**: research.md with all technology decisions and rationale documented

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Content Data Model (`data-model.md`):
- **Documentation Page**: Title, content, navigation metadata, language variants
- **Tutorial Step**: Instructions, code examples, validation criteria, next actions
- **Template Reference**: Structure analysis, customization points, usage examples
- **Example Project**: Complete demonstrations with source code and explanations

### API Contracts (`/contracts/`):
1. **Navigation Structure** (`navigation.json`):
   - Hierarchical content organization
   - Multi-language navigation mapping
   - Cross-reference and linking contracts

2. **Content Management** (`content-api.json`):
   - Content validation schemas
   - Metadata requirements
   - Update and sync protocols

3. **Internationalization** (`i18n.json`):
   - Language-specific content structure
   - Translation workflow contracts
   - Fallback and missing content handling

### Quickstart Validation (`quickstart.md`):
- New user onboarding flow (30-minute target)
- Content accuracy verification process
- Multi-language content validation
- Submodule synchronization testing

### Development Documentation:
- Mintlify-specific development guidance
- Content creation best practices
- Multi-language content management
- CI/CD pipeline maintenance instructions

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, development documentation

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load content architecture from Phase 1 design docs
- Generate tasks from documentation plan (32 pages across 8 categories)
- Each content section → content creation task [P]
- Each interactive element → component development task [P]
- Each language → translation and localization task
- CI/CD pipeline → automation setup tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Content-first approach: Structure before details
- Dependency order: Core concepts before advanced topics
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent content sections)
- Sequential for dependent content (basic concepts before advanced)

**Estimated Output**: 45-50 numbered, ordered tasks covering:
- Content creation (32 documentation pages)
- Interactive components (tutorials, examples)
- Multi-language implementation (Chinese, Japanese)
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Testing and validation
- Deployment and monitoring

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Content creation and interactive component development  
**Phase 5**: Multi-language implementation and CI/CD setup  
**Phase 6**: Testing, validation, and deployment to Mintlify Cloud

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations requiring justification*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| None | N/A | N/A |

The documentation website maintains simplicity by:
- Using Mintlify platform directly (no custom frameworks)
- Single project structure with modular content
- Straightforward CI/CD pipeline
- Clear content organization without unnecessary abstractions
