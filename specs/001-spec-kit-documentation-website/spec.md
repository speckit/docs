# Feature Specification: Spec-Kit Documentation Website

**Feature Branch**: `001-spec-kit-documentation-website`  
**Created**: 2025-09-14  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Scan the submodule in ./external folder, Then create a plan to generate a document website for that project. There is @SPEC_KIT_DOCUMENTATION_PLAN.md you can learn from it. There are a lot of good ideas."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Identified: Documentation website generation for spec-kit submodule
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Developers, Product Managers, AI Assistants, Teams
   → Actions: Learn SDD methodology, implement workflows, adopt practices
   → Data: Templates, specifications, plans, tasks, constitutional principles
   → Constraints: Must integrate with existing Mintlify setup, maintain submodule sync
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → ✅ RESOLVED: Mintlify Cloud deployment platform selected
   → ✅ RESOLVED: Interactive tutorials with CI/CD automated sync
   → ✅ RESOLVED: Multi-language support (English/Chinese/Japanese) with GitHub issues integration
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Primary flow: Developer discovers SDD → learns methodology → implements first project
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable and traceable to user value
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Documentation pages, templates, examples, workflows, constitutional rules
7. Run Review Checklist
   → Specification focuses on user value, not implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY (methodology adoption, practical guidance)
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (specific frameworks, deployment details, technical architecture)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders and development teams adopting SDD

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**As a development team**, we want to understand and adopt Spec-Driven Development methodology so that we can build high-quality software faster by transforming natural language requirements into working implementations through AI-assisted workflows.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer new to SDD, **When** they visit the documentation website, **Then** they understand the core philosophy and can complete their first project setup within 30 minutes
2. **Given** a product manager familiar with traditional PRDs, **When** they read the methodology section, **Then** they understand how SDD transforms requirements into executable specifications
3. **Given** a team adopting SDD, **When** they follow the workflow guides, **Then** they can successfully execute `/specify` → `/plan` → `/tasks` commands and generate working code
4. **Given** a developer following template references, **When** they review constitutional compliance sections, **Then** they understand quality gates and validation requirements
5. **Given** an enterprise team, **When** they review adoption guidance, **Then** they have a clear roadmap for organizational change management and success metrics

### Edge Cases
- What happens when users try to customize templates without understanding constitutional principles?
- How does the system handle version mismatches between documentation and spec-kit submodule?
- What guidance exists for teams with existing development processes that conflict with SDD principles?
- How are breaking changes in spec-kit communicated and documented for existing adopters?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

- Amendment processes and compliance tracking

### Integration with Existing Plan
The comprehensive documentation plan in `SPEC_KIT_DOCUMENTATION_PLAN.md` provides:
- 32-page content architecture across 8 categories
- 7-week implementation timeline with clear phases
- Interactive elements and quality standards
- Success metrics and maintenance strategies

### Success Criteria Alignment
