## What is Spec-Driven Development?
Spec-Driven Development (SDD) flips the script on traditional software development. For decades, code has been king — specifications were just scaffolding we built and discarded once the "real work" of coding began. Spec-Driven Development changes this: specifications become executable, directly generating working implementations rather than just guiding them.

### Beyond the Surface: SpecKit vs. Kiro

Is **SpecKit** GitHub's reaction to Amazon's Kiro? At first impression, it might seem that way. Kiro introduced a spec mode several months ago, and GitHub's **SpecKit** is deeply spec-driven. They look remarkably similar, but **SpecKit** isn't simply a reactive response.

### The Bigger Vision

GitHub's **SpecKit** is tackling a more fundamental challenge in software development. It has a much bigger ambition and vision: **to eliminate the gap between documentation and implementation**.

<Note>
**The Transformation Goal**: From documentation to implementation becomes a seamless transformation—ideally requiring no human intervention.
</Note>

This **SpecKit** documentation will guide you through this transformative methodology, showing how **spec-driven development** can revolutionize your workflow and bridge the eternal divide between what we document and what we actually build.

### What Makes SpecKit Different

Unlike traditional development approaches, **SpecKit's** methodology treats specifications as executable, living documents. This **SpecKit** framework enables:

- **Automated Implementation**: Specifications that can generate working code
- **Living Documentation**: Docs that stay synchronized with implementation
- **Constitutional Governance**: Built-in quality and consistency enforcement
- **Seamless Workflows**: From `/specify` to `/plan` to `/tasks` execution
